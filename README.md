# Blockchain-Enabled Heritage Seed Preservation

A decentralized platform empowering communities to document, preserve, and propagate heirloom and traditional seed varieties through transparent tracking, collaborative growing, and knowledge sharing.

## Overview

This project addresses the critical challenge of agricultural biodiversity loss by creating a blockchain-powered system for heritage seed preservation. By establishing a transparent framework for seed variety documentation, growing condition requirements, germination viability testing, and grower networking, the platform helps safeguard irreplaceable genetic diversity for future generations.

The system uses smart contracts to create a trustworthy record of seed varieties, their characteristics, growing requirements, and viability while connecting a global network of seed savers committed to maintaining rare and endangered plant varieties.

## Core Components

### 1. Seed Variety Registration Contract

Records and verifies details of heirloom plant varieties:
- Variety name and species classification
- Origin and cultural significance
- Physical characteristics and identifiers
- Historical documentation and provenance
- Growth cycle and harvesting parameters
- Unique genetic attributes and properties
- Photographic documentation
- Traditional uses and cultural practices

### 2. Growing Condition Contract

Tracks optimal climate and soil requirements:
- Climate zone compatibility
- Soil composition preferences
- Water requirements
- Light/shade preferences
- Companion planting recommendations
- Pest and disease resistance profiles
- Seasonal timing parameters
- Region-specific growing adaptations

### 3. Germination Testing Contract

Monitors viability of preserved seeds:
- Germination rate tracking over time
- Test methodology documentation
- Viability certification timestamps
- Rejuvenation scheduling alerts
- Storage condition verification
- Sample size and testing protocols
- Statistical reliability metrics
- Longevity projections

### 4. Grower Network Contract

Connects seed savers to maintain rare varieties:
- Grower verification and expertise levels
- Growing commitment management
- Geographical distribution mapping
- Successful propagation confirmation
- Knowledge and technique sharing
- Seed exchange coordination
- Diversity maintenance algorithms
- Community support mechanisms

## Benefits

- **For Seed Savers**: Provides documentation tools, connects to knowledge networks, ensures growing diversity, and preserves cultural heritage
- **For Communities**: Increases food sovereignty, maintains agricultural biodiversity, preserves cultural food traditions, and builds resilience against climate change
- **For Future Generations**: Safeguards irreplaceable genetic diversity, maintains adaptation options, preserves traditional knowledge, and ensures food security

## Usage Examples

### Registering a Heritage Seed Variety
```javascript
// Example code for seed variety registration
const seedRegistry = await SeedRegistry.deploy();
await seedRegistry.registerVariety(
  "0x123...", // Registrar's wallet address
  {
    commonName: "Glass Gem Corn",
    scientificName: "Zea mays",
    origin: "Oklahoma, United States",
    culturalSignificance: "Developed by Carl Barnes, a part-Cherokee farmer",
    physicalCharacteristics: "Multi-colored translucent kernels resembling glass beads",
    historicalDocumentation: "ipfs://QmX...", // Documentation hash
    growthCycle: 110, // Days to maturity
    harvestParameters: "Harvest when husks are dry and kernels are hard",
    traditionalUses: ["Ornamental", "Flour production", "Cultural ceremonies"]
  }
);
```

### Recording Germination Test Results
```javascript
// Example code for germination testing
const germinationTracker = await GerminationTracker.deploy();
const testId = await germinationTracker.recordTest(
  seedVarietyId,
  {
    testDate: "2025-03-10",
    sampleSize: 50,
    germinated: 43,
    germinationRate: 86,
    testMethod: "Paper towel method, 7 days",
    storageAge: "2 years",
    storageConditions: "Cool, dry, dark environment at 7Â°C",
    testedBy: "0xabc...", // Tester's wallet address
    notes: "Strong and uniform germination, consistent with previous testing"
  }
);
```

## Biodiversity Preservation Features

- **Rarity alerts**: Identifies varieties nearing endangerment
- **Growing zone matching**: Connects varieties with optimal growers
- **Diversity scoring**: Measures collection breadth and genetic importance
- **Success rate tracking**: Monitors propagation achievements
- **Knowledge preservation**: Documents traditional growing techniques
- **Climate adaptation tracking**: Records variety performance across changing conditions

## Implementation Roadmap

- **Q2 2025**: Initial platform development with core seed documentation features
- **Q3 2025**: Mobile app development for field documentation and testing
- **Q4 2025**: Grower network implementation and matching algorithms
- **Q1 2026**: Climate prediction integration and adaptation tracking

## Seed Sovereignty Principles

- Community ownership of genetic resources
- Documentation without patenting or restriction
- Open access to traditional knowledge
- Equitable seed sharing protocols
